As an enthusiastic food lover, I'm always eager to try local dishes and find proper ones among all. During my two years' living in Lausanne, the Swiss Olympic Capital, I've dined at various restaurants here. My friends encouraged me to make a list of the ones I'm fond of. Before we start, I have to make a note that all the recommendations are based on my personal taste, cannot garantee you will love it :)

**Le Pirate**

This nice little restaurant sits aside of Lac Leman(never call it Lake Geneva in Lausanne LOL) in Ouchy. The most famous dish of Le Pirate is the <I>mussles</I>! Tehy have around 8 different ways to cook mussles. You could try different combinations of seasonings and wines. During winter time, they serve <I>Oysters</I> from France and Italy. Also, you can find fresh fish (e.g. fillets de perches) and normal French food here.

Address: *Place de la Navigation 4, Lausanne, Switzerland*

This might be the best Japanese restaurant in Lausanne, in my personal point of view and I've been there a lot of times. It locates at east corner of <I>Esplanade de Montbenon</I>
