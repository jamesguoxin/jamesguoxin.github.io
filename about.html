## About

I was born and grew up in Hangzhou, China, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, now best known as the headquarter of Chinese e-business gaint Alibaba. After finishing my Bachelor degree from Zhejiang University, I continued my higher degree education with Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL in French), studying Communication System in Computer and Communication Department. During my three years' stay in Europe, I both worked in multinational coorperation's research institute (i.e. Sony European Technology Center) and cutting-edge start-ups (i.e. nViso SA and Tractable Ltd.). I have extensive experience in Digital Signal Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning (to be specific, Deep Learning).
